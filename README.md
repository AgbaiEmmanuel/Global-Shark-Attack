# Global Shark Attack
EDA of incidence of shark attack across 195 countries and their related causes and preventions.
Shark attacks reported over the past 100 years, including location, activity, victim info (name, gender, age), shark species, etc.

This dashboard includes the following insights as required of me:

* a trend of the shark attack annually
* countries with the most shark attack, within those countries the areas that seems to be the most dangerous.
* the body parts that are most often injured.
* certain parts of the day where shark attacks are more common, and
* species of shark that attack most often.

The data was too messy, but was able to retrieve these information of

total attacks of 6095
1467 number of shark species, and
195 total countries represented.

I hope you enjoy the visuals. Thanks
